1. Run Python 3 (I use anaconda)
2. Make sure the dependencies are installed: Flask, ATTCK, etc.
3. Run the following commands in the directory:
	set FLASK_APP=test_flask.py
	set FLASK_ENV=developtment
	flask run
4. Wait for application to finish running. This will take some time
5. Once done, go to browser
6. go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/piechart to enter the main page
7. Browse through the webpage from there
8. Once finished, press ctrl+c to exit flask from anaconda prompt
